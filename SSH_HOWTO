SSH Authentication
==================

SSH authentication uses publickey-based authentication.
To use it, you have to generate your SSH key pair and copy it to server.

1. Generate your key pair
 ssh-keygen

2. Copy your public key to remote server
 ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@remote-addr

Securing server access
----------------------

To disallow open connections from remote clients, simply block
server port in your firewall or bind server to localhost only.

Tunnelled connections will appear as local to server.

For security reasons, you can also disable password authentication on
remote server with "passwd -l user".

Using SSH tunneling on client
-----------------------------

Usage:
 usbnet -a user[@host][:port] <executable>

Example: Connect to myserver's usbexportd using SSH tunnel.
 usbnet -a john@myserver "lsusb"

Example: Tunnel to myserver, and reach usbexportd on myserver2 from myserver.
 usbnet -a john@myserver:10000 -h myserver2 "lsusb"
