SSH Authentication
==================

SSH authentication uses publickey-based authentication.
To use it, you have to generate your SSH key pair and copy it to server.

1. Generate your key pair
 ssh-keygen

2. Copy your public key to remote server
 ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@remote-addr

For security reasons, you can disable password authentication on
remote server with "passwd -l user".

Usage:
 usbnet -a ssh -u user -t remote-addr:port <executable>

Example:
 usbnet -a ssh -u john -t myserver "lsusb"
